"""Abstract base class for root-managed VHF collection.

During an experiment, some independent variable is changed before the VHF board
is to sample data, write it into permanent storage (likely NAS), and also
analyse the data (ideally from a tmpfs, such as /dev/shm, to avoid additional
disk read/write), and send the analysed data into some congregated dataset.

Common things such as disk I/O can be provided in this generic class, but the
rest need to be implemented on a per-experiment basis.
