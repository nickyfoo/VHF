"""
Perform analysis of vhf output in both radius and phase.

1. Root-mean-square error of phi(t) is studied, and the population statistics is
   determined.
2. Radius statistics (mean, std, n-th standard moments) is captured and saved.
3. Large fluctuation in phi(t), say, of at least 4000 rads within 33s, is
   recognised as multimode/faulty data.
Analysis is consequently saved into a npz file.
